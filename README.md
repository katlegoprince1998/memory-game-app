## Memory Game App

# Welcome to the Memory Game App! This interactive game is designed for two players to test their memory skills and compete against each other. Follow the instructions below to understand how the game works.
How to Play

    Accessing the Game: You can access the game via the following link: https://memory-game-app-xi.vercel.app/

    Entering Player Names: When you first load the game, you will be prompted to enter the names of the two players. Type in the names and press "Submit" to proceed.

    Gameplay: The game will display a grid of cards, each containing an image. Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time to find matching pairs.

    Matching Pairs: If a player successfully matches two cards, their score increases, and they get to play again. If the pair is incorrect, it becomes the other player's turn.

    Switching Players: Players alternate turns until one player incorrectly matches two pairs. At this point, it becomes the other player's turn.

    End of Game: The game continues until all pairs are correctly matched. Once all pairs are matched, a scoreboard will appear, displaying the final scores of both players.
